        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a certified English teacher, born in the United States, where I
          studied English and began my journey as a teacher. I currently
          live in Argentina, where I feel very comfortable teaching and learning every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I like to go for walks, drink mate, draw, and study
          new things. I am very interested in the learning process, not only as
          a teacher, but also as a curious student who always wants to
          understand a little more.
        </p>
        <p>
          My vocation for teaching began in high school, thanks to English
          teachers who left a lasting impression on me with their clarity,
          dedication, and humility. It was their way of teaching that
          inspired me to follow that same path.
        </p>

        <h2>My pedagogical approach</h2>
        <p>
          Everyone learns differently, and that is something I keep in mind when
          planning my classes. My goal is not just to teach grammar rules or
          vocabulary, but to create spaces where the language comes alive and
          makes sense for each student.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I've developed a flexible approach that combines
          different teaching methods according to the needs of the group or each
          individual. I can work with structure when necessary, but I also place
          great importance on actual language practice: speaking, listening,
          understanding, and feeling comfortable using English.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe in learning as an active process, where making mistakes is
          not a problem, but a fundamental part of the journey. My role is to
          accompany this process with patience, clarity, and commitment, so that
          each student can move forward with confidence and enjoy the process.
